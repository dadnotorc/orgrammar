/**
 * 246. Binary Tree Path Sum II
 * Easy
 * Amazon
 *
 * Your are given a binary tree in which each node contains a value.
 * Design an algorithm to get all paths which sum to a given value.
 * The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf,
 *  but it must go in a straight line down.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * {1,2,3,4,#,2}
 * 6
 * Output:
 * [[2, 4],[1, 3, 2]]
 * Explanation:
 * The binary tree is like this:
 *     1
 *    / \
 *   2   3
 *  /   /
 * 4   2
 * for target 6, it is obvious 2 + 4 = 6 and 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * {1,2,3,4}
 * 10
 * Output:
 * []
 * Explanation:
 * The binary tree is like this:
 *     1
 *    / \
 *   2   3
 *  /
 * 4
 * for target 10, there is no way to reach it.
