/**
 * 1379. The Longest Scene
 *
 * A string, each character representing a scene. Between two identical characters
 * is considered to be a continuous scene. For example: abcda, you can think of these
 * five characters as the same scene. Or acafghbeb can think of two aca and beb scenes.
 * If there is a coincidence between the scenes, then the scenes are combined.
 * For example, abcab, where abca and bcab are coincident, then the five characters
 * are considered to be the same scene. Give a string to find the longest scene.
 *
 * Notice
 * - 1 <= |str| <= 1e5
 * - str contains only lowercase letters
 *
 * Example 1
 * Input: "abcda"
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation:
 * The longest scene is "abcda".
 *
 * Example 2
 * Input: "abcab"
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation:
 * The longest scene is "abcab".
