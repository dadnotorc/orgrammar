/**
 * 53 · Reverse Words in a String
 *
 * Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.
 *
 * What constitutes a word?
 * - A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word and some words have punctuation at the end.
 * Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?
 * - Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
 * How about multiple spaces between two words?
 * - Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "the sky is blue"
 * Output: "blue is sky the"
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "hello world"
 * Output: "world hello"
