 * Give an array price is the price of all the things you want to buy.
 * The discount for buying the current item is the cheapest price of the item
 * you bought before. If the discount is greater than the price, it will be
 * free. If the discount is less than the price, you only need to pay the current
 * price minus the discount price. Return the minimum cost of buying these things.

 * Input:
 * price: [5, 2, 1, 7]
 * Output: 11
 * Explanationï¼šThe price is the default when buying the first item, the discount
 * for the second item is 5, 2 < 5 so it is free, the third item discount is 2,
 * 1 < 2 so it is also free, and the discount for the last item is 1 , so it takes
 * 7 - 1 = 6, the total cost is 6 + 5 = 11.
