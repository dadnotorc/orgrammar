2418 Â· Bit arithmetic shift left by three bits

Please obtain a natural number n from the standard input stream (console), and output the result
of the left shift of n by three bits to the standard output stream (console) through the print statement.

0 <= n <= 10000

Example
The evaluation opportunity executes your code by executing the command python main.py.
Your code needs to read data n from the standard input stream (console),
calculate the result and print it to the standard output stream (console).

Example 1
When n = 1, the printed result of program execution is: 8

Example 2
When n = 0, the printed result of program execution is:0


# main.py

```
n = int(input())

print(n << 3)
```
